playfs - maintain play list and play audio files

typically mounted under /mnt/play
/ctl
	write commands to, such as "play", "stop", "pause", "next", "previous", "repeat", "norepeat", "random", "norandom"
/events
	read events from, such as "done", "playing $path", "error $path $error" "stopped" "started"
/list
	the playlist.  read the entire list from it (each line contains a path).
	open with truncate to clear the list, write to it to add to the list.




todo:
- read audio data and write to /dev/audio ourselves, allows implementing pause 
- see why i get "audio file busy" sometimes, perhaps play doesn't get closed properly

- add mp3dec or play to this hg repo
- think about an acme program, mostly buttons that say "play" "stop" etc.
- manual pages, eventually

testing:
- somehow allow user to read currently position in playlist file? (file "offset")
- allow reading of the playlist in played order (not order of adding) (orderlist)
- give better status info in playview
- status file showing current status?
- better status messages, say what is playing.  add state to events fid when opened?
